# Real-Time-Quality-Control-System-with-Object-Detection-and-Shape-Analysis-Using-YOLOv5-and-OpenCV
This system is suitable for quality control applications in manufacturing or logistics, where it helps detect and classify products, ensuring that they meet specified shape, color, and dimensional standards. This project showcases skills in computer vision, machine learning, and real-time video processing

This code implements a **real-time quality control system** using **YOLOv5 for object detection** and **Connected Components Analysis** in OpenCV, focusing on **object and shape detection** for **quality control** in an industrial setting. Hereâ€™s a summary for your resume:

---


- **Implemented a real-time object detection system** using **YOLOv5** with **OpenCV** for a quality control application.
- **YOLOv5 detects and labels objects in real-time** from video feed, providing bounding boxes and confidence scores.
- Developed **ShapeDetector and ColorLabeler** classes to identify shapes (e.g., triangle, square, rectangle, circle) and colors (red, blue, yellow) of detected contours.
- Applied **Connected Components Analysis** to count objects in a designated inspection area and highlight detected shapes, with labeled contours indicating object count.
- Integrated functionality to determine **object orientation** (Clockwise or Counter-Clockwise) using angle calculations.

This system provides a **dual-layered detection mechanism**:
   - **YOLOv5** for general object detection with high accuracy.
   - **Connected Components Analysis** for precise shape and color-based quality inspections, enabling effective quality monitoring and control.
